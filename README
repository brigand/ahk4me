A short-url site to assist mainly with AutoHotkey programming, that uses a combination of the bit.ly API for url-shortening, a couple of forms and options to assist with that, and other options that might interest AutoHotkey scripters, like: short-urls to the documentation, get external IP, get geolocation. More APIs will be added. PHP is used (Perl might be necessary for more advanced options).

For more information, please visit the ahk4.me topic thread on the AutoHotkey Forum (http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic75499.html)

You will need at least the following:

* A webserver/hosting with PHP (and possibly Perl) support and access to the server's DNS A-Record
* A (short) domain

* A bit.ly account
- Create an account, and set your main (www) domain DNS' A-Record to point to the bit.ly server (see bit.ly site for details and instructions)

Create a folder on your webserver, and duplicate this folder-structure to your webserver (upload it)

Edit the following files:

- about/index.html (put your own info in here)
- geo/index.php (create an account at ipinfodb.com and put your own API key in there)
- shorten/index.html (put your own info in here)

Remove/ignore the following files:

- docs/.htaccess (AutoHotkey documentation specific)

Create subdomains for each "API" part, and point them to the corresponding folder.

That's basically it.

Enjoy!
