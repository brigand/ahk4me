<body>
<p>A short-url site to assist mainly with AutoHotkey programming, that uses a combination of the bit.ly API for url-shortening, a couple of forms and options to assist with that, and other options that might interest AutoHotkey scripters, like: short-urls to the documentation, get external IP, get geolocation. More APIs will be added. PHP is used (Perl might be necessary for more advanced options).
